# The Git Trinity

A bit like when we learned Bash you need to start to build a mental
model of git in your brain. And the three most important parts of that
mental model are:

1.  the branch (and its HEAD) - the current state of the repository at
    the HEAD of the last branch.
2.  the staging area - the changes that will become the *next* commit.
3.  the working copy - what is in the directory where you are working.

The thing to burn into your brain is "I fill the staging area with git
add and then add those changes to the branch with git commit."
