## Understanding the Past

After working on your project for several months you run a piece of code
that used to work but which you haven't fiddled with in awhile. It
breaks.

You write a small script to test for the error and git finds the exact
commit (change) that broke the code. Your commit log tells you why you
did it and makes it easy to resolve the problem.
