# Enter Git

Linux is a Unix-like operating system which is now probably the most
common OS in the world in terms of computer clock cycles. Although Linux
was created by Linus Torvalds, its development is a truly global
collaborative effort.

Up until ~2005 Linux was developed with BitKeeper, a proprietary
system. Some kernel developers had done a little reverse engineering of
that system and BitKeeper withdrew its free license so, over the course
of several months Torvalds developed git for the purpose of managing
distributed development of Linux.

To this day, it is still the Linux developers who use git at the highest
level and there is much to be admired about their workflow if not their
culture.
