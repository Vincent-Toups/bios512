# How to use git at the command line?

On Linuxy systems and on a Mac you should be able to use your package
manager to install git directly.

Predictably, Windows is the real hassle here. On Windows you can install
[Git For Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/), [Github
Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/), [or use git on
WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/tutorials/wsl-git).
Git is one of the few tools we'll primarily be using <u>outside</u> of
our Docker environments, so you should choose one of these and make sure
you know how to get a `git bash` going.
