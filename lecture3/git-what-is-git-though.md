# What is Git, though?

Git is a tool which allows to keep a history of your software project as
a series of "checkpoints." It also allows you or another party or
parties to maintain other *versions* of the software project, in which
case git provides extensive utilities to merge or otherwise combine or
modify multiple different "branches" or "forks" of the software.
