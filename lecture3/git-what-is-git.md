# What is Git

Git is a "revision control system." The motivation for such systems is
that it is very difficult for a group of people to work on a software
project *at the same time*. The original version control systems aimed
to solve this problem with centralized repositories.

Users would have copies of the repository (which contains the
authoritative source code for the project) and a suite of tools which
constitute the version control system would make sure that changes that
were submitted back to the official version of the code were correct.

These systems also had the benefit of keeping a history of the project.
