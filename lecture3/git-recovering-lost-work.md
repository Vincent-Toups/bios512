## Recovering Lost Work

A pothole bounces your laptop out of the window of a bus whereupon it is
run over by a cement truck.

When you get your new laptop you say:

``` bash
git clone git@github.com:Vincent-Toups/datasci611.git

```

And you get your code back at the last commit. Because you are diligent
and careful, you commit often and have only lost a day or so of work.
