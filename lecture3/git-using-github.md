# Using Github

Github is a hosting service for git repositories plus a constellation of
other utilities.

It is entirely separate from git and, in a sense, is parasitic on it.
This is typical of [Platform
Economics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platform_economy#Assessment)
and we should all be a little suspicious of it. But like the jaws of
history, we are all in the jaws of network effects and consequently we
have to accommodate github.

I will only say that there are
[alternatives](https://itsfoss.com/github-alternatives/).
