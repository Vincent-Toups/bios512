# Github?

*Github* is a website which allows you to *host* git repositories. In a
very real sense *git* and *github* are two entirely distinct entities.
One can easily spend their whole life using git productively in every
way it is intended to be used *without ever using github.*

That said, github provides a set of other services (on top of free
non-commercial hosting) that make it an attractive place to back up and
work with your git repositories. We will be using it in this course.
