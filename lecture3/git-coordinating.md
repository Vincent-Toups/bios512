## Coordinating with Other Developers

You have a data science project on github which analyzes time series
data. An interested researcher in France forks your repository and
notices an improvement can be made to your data cleaning pipeline. They
make a pull request on github.

You can see exactly what lines of code they change. Some of the changes
are good but one line is problematic. You accept only the efficacious
changes.
