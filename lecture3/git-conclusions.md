# Conclusions

So we have a basic understanding of git. There is a lot more to learn
and we shall. But now you should be able to create a repository, add
stuff to commits, associate it with a repository hosted by github, push,
etc.

Eventually we will need to learn all the powers of git. But in the
meantime this will let us get started with some data science!
